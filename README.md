An OpenGL based graphics engine made as my master's thesis work at BME.

Main functionalities:
- model loading
- texturing
- normal mapping
- camera system
- user input processing
- forward rendering
- deferred rendering
- lighting using Phong model
- light sources (diectional, point, spot)
- shadows using shadow mapping
- projective texture mapping
- skybox
- outlining using stencil testing
- post-processing
- object picking
