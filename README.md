# About the project
An OpenGL based graphics engine made as my master's thesis work at BME.
Written in C++ and GLSL using the Glad OpenGL loading library.
I also created a demo application built on the engine.
To see some screenshots from the engine and videos demonstrating the demo app, check out the
[wiki page](https://github.com/VancsodiMelinda/ProjectLaboratory/wiki).

## Main functionalities
- model loading
- texturing
- normal mapping
- camera system
- user input processing
- forward rendering
- deferred rendering
- lighting using Phong model
- light sources (diectional, point, spot)
- shadows using shadow mapping
- projective texture mapping
- skybox
- outlining using stencil testing
- post-processing
- object picking
